Two columns of data are stored here: https://bit.ly/3EHfgtO

Use gradient descent to solve for the `m` and `b` values 
with accuracy to three decimal places.

The slopes with respect to `m` and `b` against the loss function 
(sum of squares) are also provided below as expressions `D_m` and `D_b`. 

Replace the ?'s and execute the script.
